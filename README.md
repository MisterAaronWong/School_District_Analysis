# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to re-examine the original data report sent to Maria and her supervisor because the school board notified them of possible academic dishonesty for the reported math and reading scores of ninth graders in one particular school -- Thomas High School. Though the school board has not completely confirmed the extent of the academic dishonesty, Maria requested that all math and reading scores for ninth graders at Thomas High School be replaced with "NaN" ("Not a Number"), while keepiing the rest of the data intact. After the score data for Thomas High School was adjusted as requested, the school district analysis was repeated once more to analyze how those adjustments affected the overall analysis.
